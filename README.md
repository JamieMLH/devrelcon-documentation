This contains some documentation examples I made for my DevRelCon talk.

## QuickStart

In your command line, (for example, Terminal on a Mac or PowerShell on a PC), enter the following command.

**Note:** Don't copy the dollar sign :)

```sh
$ npm install fake-quickstart
```

Then, create a file called `index.js` and open it in your favorite text editor (such as Atom).

Add the following code to `index.js`:

```javascript

const packageName = require('package-name');

```

## Gif

Enter the following commands in your terminal to see:
1. If you have nvm installed
2. If so, which versions of node you have installed

```sh
$ nvm --version
$ nvm ls
```
