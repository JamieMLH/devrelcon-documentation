This contains some documentation examples I made for my DevRelCon talk.

## QuickStart

In your command line, (for example, Terminal on a Mac or PowerShell on a PC), enter the following command:

```sh
$ npm install fake-quickstart
```

Then, create a file called `index.js` and open it in your favorite text editor (such as Atom).

Add the following code to `index.js`:

```javascript

const packageName = require('package-name');

```
