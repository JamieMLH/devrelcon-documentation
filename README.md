# How to Lose a Dev In 3 Ways
This project contains a few code snippets that I created for a talk at DevRelCon SF 2019. The purpose is to demonstrate best practices in documentation. The audience for this talk is anyone who creates external documentation for software products. Please note: Most of the code below doesn't actually do anything.

**Who should use this documentation?**
1.  Anyone who wants to learn more about writing docs that are accessible and inclusive to new developers.
2.  Anyone who is new to using documentation and wants some insight on how to navigate it.

**How should you use this documentation?**
* Think of this documentation like a glossary or a how-to guide.
* Ideally, use it as a guide for best practices when you create documentation!

**Pre-requisites:**
* None

## QuickStart

In your command line, (for example, Terminal on a Mac or PowerShell on a PC), enter the following command.

**Note:** Don't copy the dollar sign :)

```sh
$ npm install fake-quickstart
```

Then, create a file called `index.js` and open it in your favorite text editor (such as Atom).

Add the following code to `index.js`:

```javascript

const packageName = require('package-name');

```

## Install NVM

NVM stands for node version manager. When you work on multiple projects, they might require different versions of node.

Enter the following commands in your terminal to see:
1. If you have nvm installed
2. If so, which versions of node you have installed

```sh
$ nvm --version
    0.31
$ nvm ls
    10.12
    8.2
```

If there is no output when you run `nvm --version`, you need to install it.
